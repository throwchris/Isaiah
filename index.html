<span class="w3-center">Chapter 53</span>

<p class="w3-justify"><span class="w3-opacity" style="font-size: x-small;">1</span> Who hath <span id="myDIV1" class="font-effect-fire" onclick="Function1()">********</span> our report? and 
    to whom is the arm of the LORD revealed?   
                      
                 

<span class="w3-opacity" style="font-size: x-small;">2</span> For he shall grow up before him as a tender plant, and as a root out of a dry ground: he hath no 
    form nor comeliness; and when we shall see him, there is no <span id="myDIV2" class="font-effect-fire"  onclick="Function2()">******</span> that we should desire him.
    

<span class="w3-opacity" style="font-size: x-small;">3</span> He is despised and rejected of men; a man of <span id="myDIV3" class="font-effect-fire" onclick="Function3()">*******</span>, and acquainted with grief: and we hid as it 
    were our faces from him; he was despised, and we esteemed him not.
      

<span class="w3-opacity" style="font-size: x-small;">4</span> Surely he hath <span id="myDIV4" class="font-effect-fire" onclick="Function4()">*****</span> our griefs, and carried our sorrows : yet we did esteem him stricken, smitten 
    of God, and afflicted.  

<span class="w3-opacity" style="font-size: x-small;">5</span> But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was <span id="myDIV5" class="font-effect-fire" onclick="Function5()">*******</span> for our iniquities: the chastisement of 
    our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed.
    
    
<span class="w3-opacity" style="font-size: x-small;">6</span> All we like sheep have gone <span id="myDIV6" class="font-effect-fire" onclick="Function6()">******</span>; we have turned every one to his own way; and the LORD hath laid on 
    him the iniquity of us all.


<span class="w3-opacity" style="font-size: x-small;">7</span> He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth: he is brought as a lamb to the 
    slaughter, and as a sheep before her <span id="myDIV7" class="font-effect-fire" onclick="Function7()">********</span> is dumb, so he openeth not his mouth.


<span class="w3-opacity" style="font-size: x-small;">8</span> He was taken from prison and from judgment: and who shall declare his <span id="myDIV8" class="font-effect-fire" onclick="Function8()">**********</span> ? for he was cut off 
    out of the land of the living: for the transgression of my people was he stricken.


<span class="w3-opacity" style="font-size: x-small;">9</span> And he made his grave with the wicked, and with the rich in his death; because he had done no <span id="myDIV9" class="font-effect-fire" onclick="Function9()">********</span>, 
    neither was any deceit in his mouth.

<span class="w3-opacity" style="font-size: x-small;">10</span> Yet it pleased the LORD to bruise him; he hath put him to grief: when thou shalt make his soul an 
    offering for sin, he shall see his seed, he shall prolong his days, and the <span id="myDIV10" class="font-effect-fire" onclick="Function10()">********</span> of the LORD shall prosper in his hand.

<span class="w3-opacity" style="font-size: x-small;">11</span> He shall see of the <span id="myDIV11" class="font-effect-fire" onclick="Function11()">*******</span> of his soul, and shall be satisfied: by his knowledge shall my righteous 
    servant justify many; for he shall bear their iniquities.

<span class="w3-opacity" style="font-size: x-small;">12</span> Therefore will I divide him a portion with the great, and he shall divide the spoil with the strong; 
    because he hath poured out his soul unto death: and he was numbered with the transgressors; and he bare the sin of many, and made <span id="myDIV12" class="font-effect-fire" onclick="Function12()">************</span> for the transgressors.

<p class="w3-center">Chapter 54</p>

<p class="w3-justify"><span class="w3-opacity" style="font-size: x-small;">1</span> Sing, O barren, thou that didst not bear; break forth into singing, and cry aloud, 
    thou that didst not travail with child: for more are the children of the desolate than the children of the <span id="myDIV13" class="font-effect-fire" onclick="Function13()">*******</span> wife, 
    saith the LORD. 
     

<span class="w3-opacity" style="font-size: x-small;">2</span> Enlarge the place of thy tent, and let them stretch forth the 
<span id="myDIV14" class="font-effect-fire"  onclick="Function14()">********</span> of thine habitations: spare not, lengthen thy cords, 
    and strengthen thy stakes;
      
    

<span class="w3-opacity" style="font-size: x-small;">3</span> For thou shalt break forth on the right hand and on the left; and thy seed shall 
<span id="myDIV15" class="font-effect-fire" onclick="Function15()">*******</span> the 
Gentiles, and make the desolate cities to be inhabited. 
      

<span class="w3-opacity" style="font-size: x-small;">4</span> Fear not; for thou shalt not be <span id="myDIV16" class="font-effect-fire" onclick="Function16()">*******</span>: neither be thou confounded; for thou shalt not be put to shame: 
for thou shalt forget the shame of thy youth, and shalt not remember the reproach of thy widowhood any more. 
 

<span class="w3-opacity" style="font-size: x-small;">5</span> For thy Maker is thine <span id="myDIV17" class="font-effect-fire" onclick="Function17()">*******</span>; the LORD of hosts is his name; and thy Redeemer the Holy One of Israel; The God of the whole earth shall he be called.   

    
    
<span class="w3-opacity" style="font-size: x-small;">6</span> For the LORD hath called thee as a woman forsaken and 
<span id="myDIV18" class="font-effect-fire" onclick="Function18()">*******</span> in spirit, and a wife of youth, when thou wast refused, 
saith thy God. 
    


<span class="w3-opacity" style="font-size: x-small;">7</span> For a small moment have I forsaken thee; but with great 
<span id="myDIV19" class="font-effect-fire" onclick="Function19()">*******</span> will I gather thee. 
      


<span class="w3-opacity" style="font-size: x-small;">8</span> In a little wrath I hid my face from thee for a moment; but with everlasting 
<span id="myDIV20" class="font-effect-fire" onclick="Function20()">********</span> will I have mercy on thee, 
saith the LORD thy Redeemer.  
    


<span class="w3-opacity" style="font-size: x-small;">9</span> For this is as the waters of Noah unto me: for as I have sworn that the waters of Noah should no more go 
over the earth; so have I <span id="myDIV21" class="font-effect-fire" onclick="Function21()">*****</span> that I would not be wroth with thee, nor rebuke thee.  
    

<span class="w3-opacity" style="font-size: x-small;">10</span> For the mountains shall depart, and the hills be removed; but my kindness shall not depart from thee, neither shall the 
covenant of my peace be <span id="myDIV22" class="font-effect-fire" onclick="Function22()">*******</span>, saith the LORD that hath mercy on thee.Â 
      

<span class="w3-opacity" style="font-size: x-small;">11</span> O thou afflicted, tossed with <span id="myDIV23" class="font-effect-fire" onclick="Function23()">*******</span>, and not comforted, behold, I will lay thy stones with fair colours, and lay thy foundations with sapphires.   
    

<span class="w3-opacity" style="font-size: x-small;">12</span> And I will make thy <span id="myDIV24" class="font-effect-fire" onclick="Function24()">*******</span> of agates, and thy gates of carbuncles, and all thy borders of pleasant stones. 
      
                     
   
<span class="w3-opacity" style="font-size: x-small;">13</span> And all thy children shall be 
<span id="myDIV25" class="font-effect-fire" onclick="Function25()">******</span> of the LORD; and great shall be the peace of thy children.


<span class="w3-opacity" style="font-size: x-small;">14</span> In righteousness shalt thou be 
<span id="myDIV26" class="font-effect-fire" onclick="Function26()">***********</span>: thou shalt be far from oppression; for thou shalt not fear: and from 
terror; for it shall not come near thee.  
    

<span class="w3-opacity" style="font-size: x-small;">15</span> Behold, they shall surely gather together, but not by me: whosoever shall gather together against thee shall fall for thy 
<span id="myDIV27" class="font-effect-fire" onclick="Function27()">****</span>. 
      

<span class="w3-opacity" style="font-size: x-small;">16</span> Behold, I have created the smith that bloweth the coals in the fire, and that bringeth forth an instrument for his 
work; and I have created the waster to <span id="myDIV28" class="font-effect-fire" onclick="Function28()">*******</span>.   
    

<span class="w3-opacity" style="font-size: x-small;">17</span> No weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper; and every tongue that shall rise against thee in judgment thou 
shalt condemn. This is the <span id="myDIV29" class="font-effect-fire" onclick="Function29()">********</span> of the servants of the LORD, and their righteousness is of me, saith the LORD.
